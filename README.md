# [SAD!](https://ms-jpq.github.io/sad)

**Space Age seD**

## What does it do?

Basically `sad` is a **Batch File Edit** tool.

It will show you a really nice diff of proposed changes _before_ you commit them.

Unlike `sed`, you can double check before you fat finger your edit.

## Preview (with fzf)

Selectively replace `std` -> `joseph joestar` in the `sad` repo.

You can pick and choose which changes to apply.

You can also choose the clustering factor for changes using `--unified=<n>`. (Same as in GNU diff)

## Preview (no fzf)

Replace all`'"(\d+)"'` -> `'ðŸŒˆ$1ðŸŒˆ'` in the `chromium` repo.

use `--commit` or `-k` to commit changes all at once.

`-c` is taken because `sad` has to trick `fzf` into thinking it's `bash` :)

## How to use sad?

**with fzf**

```sh
export GIT_PAGER='<highlighter-of-your-choice>'
# ^ can be done in your bash/zsh/rc file.
find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '<pattern>' '<replacement>'
```

**without fzf**

```sh
find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '<pattern>' '<replacement>' | highlighter-of-your-choice
```

or

```sh
find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '<pattern>' '<replacement>' --pager=<highlighter-of-your-choice>
```

or

```sh
export GIT_PAGER='<highlighter-of-your-choice>'
find "$FIND_ARGS" | sad '<pattern>' '<replacement>'
```

**gotta go fast**

If you wanna go fast.

- preview to verify you really want the changes.

- run with `--commit`, and redirect `stdout` to a file or `/dev/null`

## Requirements

Technically none of these are "required", but they make `sad` so much happier.

If you install the things below, `sad` will automatically use them. It's progressive enhancement!

### Commandline fuzzer

[**fzf**](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

`sad` does not come with a UI, it uses `fzf` to perform selection.

### Diff Colorizer

Any `git` compatible colourizer would work. I perfer these two:

[**delta**](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

`fd <files> | sad <pattern> <replacement> | delta`

[**diff-so-fancy**](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)

`fd <files> | sad <pattern> <replacement> | diff-so-fancy | less`

## Environmental Variables

| Name        | Function                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `GIT_PAGER` | `sad` will use the same pager as `git` |

## Flags

| Name             | Function                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `-f` `--flags`   | Regex flags, see below                    |
| `-k` `--commit`  | No preview, write changes to file         |
| `-0` `--read0`   | Use `\x00` as stdin delimiter             |
| `-e` `--exact`   | String literal mode                       |
| `-p` `--pager`   | Colourizing program, disable = `never`    |
| `--fzf`          | Additional Fzf options, disable = `never` |
| `-u` `--unified` | Same as in GNU `diff`, affects hunk size  |

## Regex Flags

By default, `sad` uses smartcase, and multiline matching.

| Name | Function                                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `i`  | case insensitive (works for `--exact` mode as well) |
| `I`  | case sensitive (works for `--exact` mode as well)   |
| `m`  | multiline: `^` `$` match each line                  |
| `M`  | singleline: `^` `$` match entire document           |
| `s`  | allow `.` match `\n`                                |
| `x`  | ignore whitespace and allow `#` comments            |

## Exit Codes

| Code  | Meaning                                                                                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | Good                                                                                                                   |
| `1`   | Bad                                                                                                                    |
| `130` | Interrupted (ie. user cancel), or if using `fzf`, [it will always exit `130`](https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad/issues/5). |

## GET SAD NOW!

coming soon...

### Distribution packages:

##### Debian/Ubuntu:

You can download `sad` deb packages from the [github release page](https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad/releases).

##### Arch Linux:

You can find the `PKGBUILD` on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sad/).

##### Other:

Missing a package for your favourite distribution? Let us know!

### Compile from source:

##### Requirements:

To compile sad yourself you'll have to make sure you have
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and `cargo` installed.

##### Install instructions:

To install cargo from source you can run the following commands:

```sh
cargo install --locked --all-features --path .

```

If you want to install it in a specific directory you can provide the `--root`
flag, like so:

```sh
cargo install --locked --all-features --root="/usr/bin/" --path .
```
## Use SAD inside VIM

With Floaterm plugin installed, the following script adds a command `FR` which can replace word at the cursor:

```vim
command! FR let old = expand("<cword>") | let rep = input("Replace " . old . " with: ", old) | execute ":FloatermNew --height=0.95 --width=0.95  git ls-files  | sad " . old . " " . rep
```


Use `git ls-files` for git files, use `find ./ *` for all files under work directory.


## What about stdin -> stdout

If you just want to edit the shell stream, I would recommand [`sd`](https://github.com/chmln/sd), it uses the same concept, but its more for in stream edits. `sad` was inspired by my initial useage of `sd`.

```sh
command1 | sd '<pattern>' '<replacement>' | command2
```

[`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) with `--replace` also works

```sh
command1 | rg --passthru --replace '<replacement>' -- '<pattern>' | command2
```

Take note however, `rg` will `exit 1`, it it finds no matches.
